# Laboratory 4
- I created the page "page.xhtml" which uses the 3 templates as follows:
  - The menu bar -> which contains the in the top left the title of my application
  - The page header -> the title of our laboratory which will be present in every page
  - The page footer -> copyright information related to the author of this application
- "page.xhtml" contains also a generic data vie for displaying a data table with some sample data
- I created a composite component in resources/components/selectComponent.xhtml. This component can be reused in any page to create a select input
- I also tried to create a session counter. In "page.xhtml" there is an outputText which counts the number of sessions using "SessionCounter" class
- Related to the exercise 4. in this laboratory, at the class "Tehnici avansate in ingineria programarii", our team created a hosted database as we showed to you on Tuesday.
