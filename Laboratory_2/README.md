# Laboratory 1
- I created a Business Servlet which on 'doGet' sets the attribute categories for the category select in input.jsp; the 'doPost' method adds an inserted record in the records list.
- The Record Controller 'doGet' checks if there is an action in the request:
  - if not it is set on 'categories', in order to return the categories for the select input
  - if it is set, it checks whether the action is for categories (in this case it calls the business to set the categories and after it forwards to input page) or is for records, in this case it forwards to result page
- The Record Controller 'doPost' method retrieves the fields from the form, sets the record attribute and forwards the action to business post. After it sets the action to 'records' and calls de 'doGet' method to show results page
- Captcha Servlet - 'doPost' method creates an image with the String generated by method 'generateCaptcha' and sets the text in session
- Check the captcha: in Record Controller, when the user submits the form, the app retrieve user's captcha and compares it with the one from session
- Response Decorator - adds a h1 title at the beginning of the page and a footer with the author at the end of the page
- Listener - gets from the context the init parameter 'default_category' 
- Input Filter - whenever a call to input page is made, it's logged the action: user ip and the time when the request have been made
